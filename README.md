# simulator

A very simple procedural script which i wrote very early on in python journey, the aim was to create an application for teaching mechanics and help to visualise the problem for students

# Features:
- SQLite persistent database for storing test scores
- Test 3 different areas of mechanics: Flat plane, Free fall and projectiles
- A simulator that takes as input velocity and angle of elevatin, uses turtle to simulate this, uses SUVAT equations to determine flight of the ball
- Also includes visualisations: Velocity-time graph and displacemet-time graph, using matplotlib

# Get started:
- Requires matplotlib: `python -m pip install -U matplotlib`
